 **Includes more features and automation**
<br/> *Updated version of this project.*

## General Layout of this project:
 1. User types in keyword and a location(autocomplete included)
 2. Parsed form data is then sent to google maps api.
 3. In which returns lat / lon coordinates.
 4. Using this data we're able to get unique results from flickr api.
 5. Each image returned from flickr is then sent to faceplusplus. If it contains a face, it is included in data and is displayed.
 6. User has the option to query multiple locations which will return a bar chart which tells them which location had higher smiles.

## Beta:
 - Project will soon be modular so anyone could bring in their own api keys.
 - Better data structure
