 General Layout of this project:
User types in keyword and a location(autocomplete included)
Parsed form data is then sent to google maps api.
In which returns lat / lon coordinates.
Using this data we're able to get unique results from flickr api.
Each image returned from flickr is then sent to faceplusplus. If it contains a face, it is included in data and is displayed
User has the option to query multiple locations which will return a bar chart which tells them which location had higher smiles.
